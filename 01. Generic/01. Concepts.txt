## Introduction
## In order to run kubernetes locally and practice development, we need to install one of the below tools:

## 1. kind: kind lets you run Kubernetes on your local computer. This tool requires that you have Docker installed and configured.

## 2. minikube: minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes. 
##    minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer (including Windows, macOS and Linux PCs) 
##    so that you can try out Kubernetes, or for daily development work.

## 3. kubeadm: You can use the kubeadm tool to create and manage Kubernetes clusters. It performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable, 
##    secure cluster up and running in a user friendly way. It can create multi node cluster.

## 4. Container rutime: In kubernetes all nodes must have container runtime istalled, includeing master and worker. The kubernetes system pods, running in master node,
##    so master node also need container runtime. Container runtime: Docker, ContainerD, CRI-O etc.


## Start minikube in computer
> minikube start

## Start minikube with a specific driver.
> minikube start --driver=hyper-v/vmware

## Get the information about the runnug cluster
> kubectl cluster-info

## In order to connect to minikube node, we need to know the IP address of the minikube node. 
> minikube ip
