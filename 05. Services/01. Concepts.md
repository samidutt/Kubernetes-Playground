### What is Service in Kubernetes:.

In kuberenetes, services are single point of entry for accessing one or more pod.
Explanation: 
As pod is a mortal object in K8S or ephemeral(short lived). It can be deleted, damaged or died, and new pods takes place of the old pods. So the Ip address of the pod is not constent. In this scenario, we need to abstruct the Ip address of the pod and and provide uninterupted connection. 


### Diagram:

[Outside world] => [Service{ Ip:10.0.0.1, label:myapp }] => [Pod{ ip: 10.10.0.1, label: myapp}]
Note: The label is very important, because the labels will be used to associate a service to one or more pods.


### Benefits:
1. Service abstructs the Ip address of the pods.
2. Service provides reliable Ip address to connect to one or more pods.
3. Service provides built-in loadbalancer feature to distribute the load among pods.
4. Service works on layer 4(TCP/UDP).
5. Servics are not ephemeral(short lived)
