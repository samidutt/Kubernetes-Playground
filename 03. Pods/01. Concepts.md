## Introduction

### Pod:
1. Pod is the basic unit of executionof a Kubernetes application. This is the smallest unit in Kubernetes object model that we create and deploy.
2. Pods are created to run containers.
3. Pod has an Ip address, memory, volumes etc. and these are shared across multiple containers running inside the Pod.
4. Pods live and die and never comes back to life once die. If Kubernetes finds a pod as unhealty it gets terminated and new Pods are created in place of old one.
5. Pods can be horizontally scaled and created multiple identical pods. These identical instances called Replicas.
6. When there are multiple instances running of a Pod, Kubernetes load balance the traffic among these Pods.
7. Each Pod withing an node must have an unique Ip address. 
8. Containers within a single Pod will have an unique port number to access it.
9. Pods cannot span across several nodes. One Pod can be reside onlyn inside one single node.

### Create a Pod:
There are several ways to schedule a Pod:
1. kubectl run command: This is the imperative way to schedule a pod.
> Kubectl run [Podname] --image=[image name]
> kubectl port-forward [Podname] [9000(External port to connect):5000(internal pod port)]

2. kubectl create/apply command with yaml file: In this way we create a yaml file to deploy a Pod in declarative way.  The yaml file is used with create or apply command with kubectl.
